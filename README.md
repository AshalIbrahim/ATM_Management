Login class is the actual main class
Project Description:
The login class when clicked will ask for your card id and pin credentials, you will not be having them since you've just actually opened it for the first time
--> you'll then click on Sign Up --> Sign Up class opens and then follows three pages of information being stored on 3 different classes which are integrated to a database in MySQL: SignUp, SignUpAddition, SignUpThree
After filling up the form presented in SignUpThree, the user is handed his own id card and pin credentials
Currently working on operations that take place after logging in
